# Unit Testing Status Report

## Current Status: **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

### Overview
While the backend development for the event registration platform has been completed with comprehensive admin functionality, blog system, and member management, **unit testing has not yet been implemented**.

### What Has Been Developed (Ready for Testing)

#### üîê Authentication & Security
- JWT token authentication system
- Role-based access control (RBAC) middleware
- Password hashing and validation
- Admin permission checks

#### üìä Admin System
- Admin user management API (`api/admin-users.js`)
- Blog post management API (`api/admin-blog.js`)
- Category management API (`api/admin-categories.js`)
- Member management API (`api/admin-members.js`)
- Admin dashboard interface (`public/admin/dashboard.html`)

#### üìù Blog System
- Blog post CRUD operations
- Category management
- Publishing workflow
- Public blog interface

#### üë• Member Management
- User registration system
- Member approval workflow
- Profile management
- Baptism management

#### üóÑÔ∏è Database Integration
- Supabase integration
- Enhanced schema with admin roles
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Data validation and sanitization

### Priority Testing Areas (Recommended Implementation Order)

#### 1. **Critical Security Tests** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] JWT token validation and expiration
- [ ] Admin role verification
- [ ] Password hashing verification
- [ ] Input sanitization tests
- [ ] SQL injection prevention

#### 2. **Core Business Logic Tests** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] User registration flow
- [ ] Member approval process
- [ ] Blog post creation and publishing
- [ ] Category management operations

#### 3. **API Endpoint Tests** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] Admin API endpoints response validation
- [ ] Error handling and status codes
- [ ] Request parameter validation
- [ ] Pagination and filtering logic

#### 4. **Database Integration Tests** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] Supabase connection handling
- [ ] RLS policy enforcement
- [ ] Data integrity checks
- [ ] Transaction rollback scenarios

#### 5. **Performance & Edge Cases** (LOW PRIORITY)
- [ ] Large dataset handling
- [ ] Concurrent user scenarios
- [ ] Rate limiting tests
- [ ] Memory usage optimization

### Testing Framework Setup (Ready to Implement)

The project already includes:
- ‚úÖ Vitest configuration (`vitest.config.js`)
- ‚úÖ Test setup file (`tests/setup.js`)
- ‚úÖ Sample test files structure:
  - `tests/auth.test.js` (placeholder)
  - `tests/api.test.js` (placeholder)
  - `tests/unit.test.js` (placeholder)

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Implement Authentication Tests First**
   - Focus on JWT validation and admin role checks
   - Test password security functions

2. **Add API Endpoint Tests**
   - Test all admin CRUD operations
   - Validate error responses and edge cases

3. **Database Integration Testing**
   - Test Supabase connections and queries
   - Validate RLS policy enforcement

4. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Test complete user workflows
   - Validate admin dashboard functionality

### Test Coverage Goals
- **Target**: 80%+ code coverage
- **Critical paths**: 100% coverage for authentication and admin functions
- **API endpoints**: 90%+ coverage for all CRUD operations

### Notes
- All backend functionality is complete and ready for testing
- Test files structure is in place but needs implementation
- Priority should be given to security-related tests
- Consider adding integration tests for the admin dashboard UI
